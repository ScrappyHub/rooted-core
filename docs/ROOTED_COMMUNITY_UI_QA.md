# ROOTED — FULL SYSTEM DEBUG GUIDE (HONEST PASS)

Status: ✅ Canonical  
Scope: ROOTED Core + ROOTED Community (Live Vertical Only)

This is the single **honest debug authority** for everything that is:

✅ Live  
✅ Fragile  
✅ Stable  
✅ Designed-only  
✅ Disabled by doctrine  

This file must agree with:

- ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
- ROOTED_GIT_HANDOFF.md
- ROOTED_DEBUG_TOOLKIT_CORE.md
- MODERATION_SYSTEM.md
- NOTIFICATIONS_SYSTEM.md

If any UI appears to exist but this guide says it is OFF → it is OFF.
If a feature exists in schema but not in this file → it is NOT production-ready.

This guide is allowed to be brutally honest.
Marketing language is forbidden here.
