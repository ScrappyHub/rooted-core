## Governance Boundaries
This repository:

Does NOT define roles, tiers, or access laws
Does NOT change database schema or RLS
Does NOT define Kids Mode or sanctuary rules
All governance and access control lives in:

→ https://github.com/.../rooted-platform

Any change that attempts to bypass ROOTED governance is invalid by design.

✅ LIVE PRODUCTION VERTICAL

This repository powers the ONLY live user-facing product:

→ ROOTED Community (local food, vendors, events, landmarks)

All other ROOTED vertical repositories (Construction, Healthcare, Emergency, Workforce, etc.) are:

- Planning and governance docs only
- Not active products
- Not launch promises or public announcements

This app obeys all platform governance defined in:

→ rooted-core/docs/
→ rooted-platform/docs/
